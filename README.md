# C++ Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of C++ projects from my computer science studies in Ukraine. It serves as a showcase of my programming skills and the projects I have completed as part of my coursework (1st semester). Each project focuses on different aspects of C++ programming and demonstrates my understanding of fundamental concepts and problem-solving abilities.
